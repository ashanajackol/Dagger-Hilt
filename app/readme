This project is for dagger hilt dependency injection

what is needed,
- dagger hilt dependency
- retrofit dependency

Two injection types
- constructor
- field

Step one
-  needs to create 'AppModule' where we define all the dependencies

AppModule annotations - Read the 'AppModule' class in di package
---------------------
@Module - To identify this is the class defining dependencies
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class) - All the dependencies define in this class live long as App lives

If need application context to be an dependency
- Create application class
- Annotated as '@HiltAndroidApp'
Check how 'MyRepositoryImpl' and 'AppModule' 'provideMyRepository' use context as dependency
